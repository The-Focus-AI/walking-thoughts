# Focus.AI Design System

A design system that combines Swiss International Style structural rigor with Focus.AI's brand identity. Warm paper backgrounds, editorial typography, rigorous grid, generous whitespace, opacity-based hierarchy, and restrained accent color.

## Six Principles

1. **Grid first.** Every layout lives on a 12-column grid (editorial pages use a 3-column asymmetric variant). 8px base unit for spacing.
2. **Mobile first, always.** Design for 320px, then expand. Use `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` prefixes systematically.
3. **Whitespace is structure.** Generous padding and margins are the design, not waste.
4. **Opacity creates hierarchy.** Never introduce a second text color to indicate weight. Use opacity on the primary text color.
5. **Two accents maximum, used sparingly.** Primary accent for CTAs and navigation. Secondary accent for decorative highlights only.
6. **Clarity over decoration.** Every element earns its place. If it doesn't help the reader focus on what matters, remove it.

## Brand Architecture

```
The Focus.AI
├── Focus.AI (Client)     → Services, products, client-facing work
│   Aesthetic: Editorial magazine, polished, confident
│   Palette: Paper, Ink, Petrol, Vermilion
│
└── Focus.AI Labs         → Research, experiments, public content
    Aesthetic: Bell Labs research report, curious, generous
    Palette: Paper, Void, Rand-Blue, Alert-Red
```

**Rule of thumb**: Client work or selling services → Client brand. Sharing learnings or exploring → Labs brand.

## Quick Reference

### Typography

| Family      | Font           | Usage                                                       |
| ----------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Display** | Source Serif 4 | Cover titles, H1 (paged reports), pull quotes, stat numbers |
| **Sans**    | Inter          | Section headings (h2–h4), body text, UI, navigation         |
| **Mono**    | Courier Prime  | Labels, metadata, code, page numbers                        |

**Weight rules:**

- Headings: `font-black` (900) or `font-bold` (700) with negative letter-spacing
- Body: `font-normal` (400) or `font-medium` (500), line-height 1.6
- Labels: `font-mono`, uppercase, wide letter-spacing

### Colors at a Glance

| Role             | Client              | Labs                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Background       | Paper `#faf9f6`     | Paper `#f3f2ea`      |
| Primary text     | Ink `#161616`       | Void `#1a1a1a`       |
| Secondary text   | `ink/70` opacity    | `void/70` opacity    |
| Tertiary text    | `ink/40` opacity    | `void/40` opacity    |
| Primary accent   | Petrol `#0e3b46`    | Rand-Blue `#0055aa`  |
| Secondary accent | Vermilion `#c3471d` | Alert-Red `#d93025`  |
| Border           | `#d4d3cf`           | `rgba(26,26,26,0.2)` |

**Never use pure `#ffffff` or `#000000` for backgrounds.**

### Opacity Hierarchy (Core Rule)

Reduce opacity to de-emphasize — never change the hue:

```
Full:     text-[ink]           → primary content
Softer:   text-[ink]/70        → secondary labels, supporting text
Quiet:    text-[ink]/40        → captions, metadata
Ghosted:  text-[ink]/20        → disabled, placeholder
```

### Spacing

Base unit: **8px**. Every spacing value is a multiple of 8.

| Context | Value    | Usage                           |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| Tight   | 8px      | Inline gaps, icon spacing       |
| Default | 16px     | Component internal spacing      |
| Between | 32px     | Between components              |
| Section | 48–64px  | Section padding (mobile/tablet) |
| Section | 96–128px | Section padding (desktop)       |

### Layout

Two layout modes:

1. **12-column grid** — General purpose, Tailwind `grid grid-cols-12 gap-8`
2. **Asymmetric editorial** — `[144px label] [1fr content, max 740px] [192px marginalia]`

Body text max width: `60ch`. Never wider.

## Gotchas

- **Never pure white or pure black** — Use paper tones and ink/void.
- **Never `font-bold` alone on headings** — Use `font-black` (900) with tight negative tracking.
- **Body text max 60ch** — Wider columns hurt legibility.
- **Generous section padding** — Minimum `py-12` (48px), standard `py-16`–`py-24` (64–96px).
- **Labels are always mono** — `Courier Prime`, uppercase, wide letter-spacing.
- **Border-radius is subtle** — 4–8px for cards/buttons. Never fully rounded on large containers.
- **Opacity, not gray shades** — `text-ink/70` not `text-gray-500`.
- **Warm backgrounds** — Even dark mode uses warm charcoal, not cold black.
- **Source Serif 4 is display only** — Never for body text or h2–h4. Only cover titles, h1 in paged reports, pull quotes, stat numbers.
- **Two accents max** — Primary for actions/links, secondary used sparingly for decorative highlights.
- **Every layout works on mobile** — Default classes are mobile. Always add `md:` / `lg:` variants.
